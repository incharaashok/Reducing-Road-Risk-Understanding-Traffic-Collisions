## Overview
This project analyzes traffic crash patterns in **Montgomery County, Maryland** by merging driver and non-motorist datasets.  
Our work focuses on understanding how **environmental conditions**, **roadway characteristics**, and **human behavior** influence crash frequency and injury severity.

The analysis includes:
- Comprehensive **data cleaning**
- **Feature engineering**
- **SQL exploratory analysis**
- **Visualization** in Python and Tableau

We uncover insights about fault distribution, injury patterns, traffic control effectiveness, and high-risk scenarios.

## Key Findings
- No single factor (weather, surface condition, traffic control, etc.) independently explains crash frequency—incidents arise from **multiple overlapping conditions**.
- Even in typically “safe” conditions (clear weather, dry roads, daylight), crashes remain common due to **exposure levels and interacting risks**.
- **Poor driving behavior** and **passive or insufficient traffic control** significantly increase crash likelihood.
- The proposed **Road Risk Severity Index (RRSI)** identifies and ranks high-risk road segments for targeted safety interventions.
- Increasing **public awareness** around high-risk areas can further reduce collision rates.

## Data & Tools

### **Datasets**
- Crash Reporting – Drivers  
- Crash Reporting – Non-Motorists  
- Merged Crash-Level Dataset (created for this project)

### **Technologies Used**
- **SQL (BigQuery):** cleaning, joining, analysis  
- **Python:** pandas, numpy  
- **Tableau:** visualizations and dashboard creation

## Summary
This project provides a structured, data-driven analysis of crash dynamics in Montgomery County.  
It highlights how **environment**, **behavior**, **infrastructure**, and **vehicle characteristics** jointly shape crash outcomes.

The work demonstrates practical skills in:
- Data wrangling  
- SQL analytics  
- Visualization  
- Insight generation  

reflecting the analytical training in the **MSBA curriculum**.
